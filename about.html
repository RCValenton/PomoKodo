          <p>Feeling intimidated by the technical interviewing process? We the developers of Pomokodo, understand that feeling of deep despair all too well. But fear not, Pomokodo was invented to help students who are starting to prepare for those tricky technical interviews. 
  
            <br><br>Inspired by the well-known Pomodoro method, this webpage includes designated timers for different levels of coding challenges. In addition to our challenge timers, there are timers for studying the solution and taking a break. 
            
            <br><br>Our goal is to help students break up their time into manageable segments when working on coding problems. This helps combat the scenario of brooding over a problem for hours to only get burnt out and discouraged from continuing your journey. 
            
            <br><br>We know that every student is bright and brilliant, and most of all working hard to land their dream job. The PomoKodo team wishes you the best of luck!<br><br>
