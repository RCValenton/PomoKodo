# Description

The product, PomoKodo, will be a web application designed in JavaScript. The purpose of PomoKodo is to help computer science students manage their time when practicing coding challenge problems in preparation for technical interviews. This web application has 3 pages. Displayed on the main page will be animated PomoKodo logos and a navigation bar. On the Timer page will have five timer options: Easy (30 minutes), Medium (50 minutes), and Hard (70 minutes), Break (15 Minutes), and Solution Study (120 Minutes). Each timer is associated with a different level coding problem that the client decides to attempt. In addition to the timers, the user can play music from the integrated Spotify API. Lastly, the About page includes a mission statement and information about the timer page in a virtual schedule format.

# How to Install & Run

1. Download the repo.
2. Run the index.html file to see the webpage appear in browser.


# How to Use PomoKodo

Whilst preparing for technical interviews, users can start a coding challenge from a website like LeetCode and select the according timer (Easy, Medium, Hard). After the timer is up, the user can choose the break timer to rest before starting the 120-minute study timer to study the coding challenge solution. The user can stop the timer at any point with the stop button. After finishing one round of timers, it is encouraged to come back to re-attempt the coding challenge until proficiency.
